# Pic_Link_To_Word
Work Project


This script takes an excel file full of data from an app collected from a survey of air handler unit (AHU) coils. 
Each coil has a variable number of pictures (up to 6). These pictures are stored as links to download each image.
A word document will be created with a collapsable section for each AHU coil that contains all pictures for that coil.
